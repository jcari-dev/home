# Welcome to Jorge's LoL Stat Website! (Project 1)


For my first project I attempted to create a League of Legends stat website using Riot Game's API. 



##

|                |Features|
|-|-------------------------------|
||`Ranked match user information.`            |
||`Ranked match rank and division information.`            |
||`Shows user match info including: KDA, items,summoner spells, etc.`|
||`Shows items purchased during the match and redirects the user info their wikia page.`|
||`Overall winrate from the last 10 games.`|
||`Overall winrate from other players along with your own rank and division.`|
||`Additional match info e.g. time being CCed and time spent CCing.`|
||`Champion image used by the user, redirects to their wikia page. `|

That's pretty much all for now, I will continue to develop this. Thanks,

Roadmap:
Get champion ally and enemy tips on hover.
Organize the matches in other form.
Clean the way that information is appended.
Add Graphs in regards to the information.
Add the champion and name of the other 9 participants.
